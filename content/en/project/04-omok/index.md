## <i class="fab fa-python"></i> Project Overview

This project is a **Gomoku (Five in a Row)** program  
developed to study **Game Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.  

The player and the computer take turns placing stones on the board,  
and the AI selects the optimal move using the **Minimax algorithm** with **search depth limitation**.
