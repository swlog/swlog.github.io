## <i class="fab fa-python"></i> Project Overview

This project is a **Python implementation designed to understand search algorithms**,  
applying the concept of **state-space search**.  

It is a classic puzzle problem where eight numbered tiles are moved one step at a time  
to reach the goal state. The project began with simple array manipulation,  
and later integrated **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**, **DFS (Depth-First Search)**, and **heuristic-based search (A\*)**,  
providing a deeper understanding of the importance and efficiency of algorithms.
